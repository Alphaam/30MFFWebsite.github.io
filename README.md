Project Name: Things in Quarantine

Project Description: The project was to create a curatorial website to provide brief insight on the thought process that went behind creating the characters in the film as well as the film itself. The intended experience was one of being in a museum with art work that has descriptive tags. I wanted the scrolling to be smooth to replicate the feel of examining art in a museum i.e. as a continuous flow of exposure as oppoed to separate pages taht felt very interrupted.      


Process: I invested more time on aesthetics because I thought that that was what would create the museum feel. I, therefore, experimented with pallates, prints and posters. I eventually landed on a design that resembled a museum brochure by utilizing the wrapped feature. 

Reflection/Evaluation: The initial concept was not met in it's entirety. I started off wanting to have a very central cinematic feel and so started off by encorporating multiple film-relevant iconography. That ended up feeling too clustered and I craved a more refined, and neat implememntation. That led to developing the museum curatorial theme that I eventually translated into creating a virtual museum brochure. After that, I revised the website in a way that compromised the museum curatorial feel with a presentation that resembled a screening a film using a projector. To accomplish that I created slightly transluscent canvases on which the content of the website is presented to mimic the feel of projecting film onto a blank canvas. I encorporated scrolling by using buttons to sustain the uniterrupted feel of the website as much as I could and also to avoid having the white canvases only appearing partially on the screen, an occurence that would take away from the movie-projected onto-canvas aesthetic I was going for.

A concern I have is my reluctancy to use JavaScript. I often found myself carrying out functions that could be done by JavaScripts using CSS solely because I did not feel very comfortable using JavaScriptt. Ultimately, the JavaScript implementation in my website is very minimal.

I am overall very happy with the end result.
