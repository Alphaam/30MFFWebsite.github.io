Project Name: Things in Quarantine

Project Description: The project was to create a curatorial website to provide brief insight on the thought process that went behind creating the characters in the film as well as the film itself. The intended experience was one of being in a museum with art work that has descriptive tags. I wanted the scrolling to be smooth to replicate the feel of examining art in a museum i.e. as a continuous flow of exposure as oppoed to separate pages taht felt very interrupted.      


Process: I invested more time on aesthetics because I thought that that was what would create the museum feel. I, therefore, experimented with pallates, prints and posters. I eventually landed on a design that resembled a museum brochure by utilizing the wrapped feature. 

Reflection/Evaluation: The initial concept was not met in it's entirety. I started off wantiung to have a very central cinematic feel and so started off by encorporating multiple film-relevant iconography. That ended up feeling too clustered and I craved a more refined, and neat implememntation. That led to developing the museum curatorial theme that I eventually translated into creating a virtual museum brochure. I am overall very happy with the end result.
